# Ansible — Quick Reference

Ansible is an open-source, agentless automation tool by Red Hat. It uses simple, human-readable YAML files called playbooks to automate configuration management, application deployment, task automation, and orchestration across many systems.

## What You Can Do
- Automate configuration and deployments across many servers.
- Run ad-hoc commands for troubleshooting or on-the-fly fixes.
- Orchestrate complex workflows (deployments, rolling updates).
- Integrate with cloud providers, networking devices, and CI/CD pipelines.

## Key Characteristics
- **Agentless:** No agents required on managed nodes — uses SSH (OpenSSH) for Linux/UNIX and WinRM for Windows.
- **Declarative Playbooks:** Describe the desired state; Ansible figures out the steps to reach it.
- **Idempotent Modules:** Most modules are idempotent — safe to run multiple times.
- **Extensible:** Custom modules, plugins, and roles allow flexible extension.

## Architecture
- **Control node:** Machine where you run `ansible` or `ansible-playbook` (typically Linux/macOS with Python). Multiple control nodes are allowed.
- **Managed nodes (hosts):** Servers, network devices, or virtual machines that Ansible manages.
- **Inventory:** A file or directory that lists your managed hosts and groups (INI or YAML format).
- **Modules:** Reusable units that perform tasks (package management, file operations, service control).
- **Playbooks & Tasks:** Playbooks are ordered lists of plays (target hosts + tasks). Tasks call modules.
- **Connection plugins:** Control how Ansible connects (SSH, WinRM, local).

## Common Module Categories
- System modules (user, group, package, service)
- File modules (copy, template, file)
- Command modules (command, shell)
- Networking modules (nxos, ios, eos, junos)
- Cloud modules (aws, azure, gcp)
- Application modules (docker, kubernetes)

## Quick Commands
- Run an ad-hoc command:
```
ansible all -m ping -i inventory
```
- Run a playbook:
```
ansible-playbook -i inventory site.yml
```
- Check host connectivity:
```
ansible all -m ping -i inventory
```
